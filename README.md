# neSia Programming Language

**neSia** is a small interpreted programming language I'm building to deepen my understanding of low-level system concepts, interpreters, and computer architecture.

It's heavily inspired by [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com), but I'm putting my own spin on the design and implementation.
